- **Video Stream:** Join with your friends on a video call for a healthy fitness competition.
- **Win Rewards:** Be a top performer and win discount points and get a chance to win free elite pass.

## Novelty

- Firstly, we plan to integrate a pose detection algorithm on a live video stream, so that the
algorithm will keep a count of the exercises performed, while the user is in a video call with his
peers. Such functionality does not exist in present day fitness apps. 
- Secondly, we will train an ML model to classify various yoga poses and also predict their
accuracies. The work done in this field is very limited and we hope to extend it.
- Thirdly, we plan to gamify our application and make it as interactive as possible. This will help
to build the motivation among our users to continue exercising even in virtual mode.

## Potential Impact of our solution

Our solution has the potential to impact millions of fitness freaks who miss the gym
environment during the Covid-19 lockdown and find it difficult to exercise alone. With physical
training facilities shut down all across the globe, our solution will provide an effective mode to
revive the motivation to exercise and build a healthy fitness community globally.
